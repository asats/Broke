 <b>What is BrokeAsF?<b><br>
 
BrokeAsF has a double meaning - it stands for Broke as F***& Broke at San Francisco (SF)</font>.<br>
BrokeAsF aims to provide you with locations near you offering free food for that day. The goal of BrokeAsF
is to provide these locations in multiple places all over not only SF.Note: Some locations require sign-up, but are still completley free. Other locations provided may offer free food on regular days within an extended time period.
These locations are continuously displayed for the duration of that time, regardless of if they're offered that day.
These locations will be properly noted.<br><br>

<b>Using BrokeAsF</b><br>
Allow BrokeAsF to access your location when prompted. Your location will be displayed on the map indicated by an
icon of a person. The map will then display markers in your area with places offering free food. These clickable markers will provide information
regarding the location i.e. the address, food offered, and any information regarding sign-up (if necessary).<br><br>
